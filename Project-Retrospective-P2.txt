3.Let’s imagine that your next project was to improve and extend P2. What are the features/functionality you would add, use cases you would support, etc? Are there any weaknesses in your current implementation that you would like to improve upon? This should include at least three areas you would improve/extend.
A: If the next project was to improve and extend P2, I would like to improve the load balancing of my P2. Now I only send map job to the first replica of chunk. Also I would like to implement some more fun job.
